I want to create a discord bot that responds to commands. The bot should respond to commands:

/config $bot_name $model_name $sys_prompt. 
/create_bot $bot_name $model_name $sys_prompt

/config should configure an existing bot, while /create_bot would create a brand new bot and use the parameters.

When a bot receives a message, if it's addressed to it or to @everyone, it should respond. 
It should push the latest message and response to a qdrant vector store.
Based on this information, it should be able query an LLM using LangChain. 
Read environment variables from .env file.

I want to create qdrant data in memory and later switch to qdrant remote url
